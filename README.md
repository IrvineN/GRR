**Automating IC Handler Gage RnR Analysis**

During my internship at a semiconductor company in Singapore, I developed a tool to automate the Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (RnR) analysis for Test engineers. The company's tool was built based on https://github.com/DavidGattrell/STDF.RADAR. I customized this tool to meet the specific data configurations and needs of the company.

The tool streamlines the conversion of stdf files from IC handlers into final Excel spreadsheets, reducing a time-consuming manual process that typically takes an entire day to just 5 minutes.

Please note that I can only share censored versions of my scripts due to the confidentiality of the data.
